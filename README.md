Flask REST API which predicts probability of Coronary Heart Disease in a patient taking 9 parameters based on patient's history as input.

The API uses a Logistic Regression Model from scikit-learn trained on the [Framingham Heart Study Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset) from Kaggle.

The model achieved a test accuracy of around 88%.

It is deployed on [here](https://heart-sn1y.onrender.com/).

## /predict endpoint

- Takes 9 paramteres as input
- Returns a binary prediction (0 or 1) and probability as well.
